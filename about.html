    <h3 class="pink-header about-text">SYNOPSIS</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">Riley Kennedy Stark and Tess Lancaster have a story to tell you about The Horniest Girls in New York City, Tess and Rileys. It is an underdog story about two girls who are terrible at making good choices, coming of age together with their friend Derek when they realize they have been letting life, sex, drugs, and Tess’s cult past bend them over a table. With an unrepentant love of friendship and a little help from a lesbian pastor, the two girls overcome their submissive natures and grab life by its balls. Together, they learn how to top the world. </p>

  <h3 class="pink-header about-text">Other Information About The Show</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">It’s really funny and good! Also, Tess is an Accessibility Coordinator and would ideally like to have at least one performance be as accessible as can be (touch tour, audio description, captioning). We are in the process of creating the audio description and captioning and would love to work with you, see what is possible, and expand the audience for the show!

    <p class="white-box-text">Toonieroonie Productions is a comedic animation company based in Brookly, New York. Owners Tess Lancaster and Riley Kennedy Stark, who independently perform sketch comedy and improv, expanded the company this year to include stage performance. Toonieroonie’s first performance of The Horniest Girls in New York City was held on March 14th with The Village Salon in Manhattan. A link to the performance has been provided in the “Video Link” response section. This would be the company’s first time to Fringe (exciting!).</p>
